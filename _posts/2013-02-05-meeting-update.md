The past 2 weeks have been relatively quiet, but solid progress towards our
goals of flight testing and systems testing in the field are being made.  
    
Testing, debugging, and commenting code were done on both the ground station
and onboard imaging over the last few weeks with the aim of fixing some
persistent bugs and revising code for clarity. This week's technical demo was
of the onboard camera:

Sheldon's technical demo of the FPV camera with image on a small LCD screen

  

  

Sheldon is planning to get the camera mounted to the plane as well as connect
it to the plane's power supply in the next few weeks.  
  
  
  
  
  
On the airframe front, the foam airplanes for flight testing are complete and
ready to fly. The team is continuing to try and find a suitable flying field
and time for the foamies. In the meantime, potential pilots are training on
the flight simulator:

We also started work on prototyping a new design for the plane's landing gear
mount.

Justin puts his carpentry skills to use

This design is part of several changes we made to the landing gear to increase
overall robustness in the light of several accidents with the landing gear
that occurred during competition last year.
