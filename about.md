## Who we are ##

UAARG is a student vehicle project in the Faculty of Engineering. We design and build our own UAV systems, typically of similar size to radio controlled model airplanes. Every year a system is designed, built, tested and then competed internationally. We offer the opportunity for students to put theory into practice and gain valuable design and management experience. If you join the group you will get the following opportunities:

* Make new friends
* Develop new skills
* Help build an airplane
* Work on an autopilot
* Program the on-board computer
* Help develop imaging payload systems
* International travel
* A great resume booster
