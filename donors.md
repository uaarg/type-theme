Unmanned, autonomous aerial vehicles are increasingly being used for a a variety of civilian and military applications. The applications of UAVs meet diverse needs including search and rescue, law enforcement, and environmental, forest fire or pipeline monitoring. Imagine the possibilities of a system that flies, records data, analyzes it, and sends back the information you need at the touch of a button! UAVs are able to save large amounts of money and man-power while maintaining safety, efficiency, and accuracy.

Sponsors will have their logo displayed on our competition aircraft as well as on our webpage. If you would like further information, please contact [Cindy Xiao](dixin@ualberta.ca). We look forward to hearing from you!
