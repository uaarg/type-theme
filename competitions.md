Throughout the year, UAARG designs and develops autonomous aircraft for student competitions, where we perform a full flight demonstration of our aircraft. We attend the following competitions each year:

## Unmanned Systems Canada Student UAV Competition ##
At the [Unmanned Systems Canada Student UAV Competition](http://www.unmannedsystems.ca/content.php?doc=223), student teams are asked to fly over a search area cover a search area containing multiple regions and targets of interest, and collect information about those regions.

## AUVSI Student UAS Competition ##
[Association of Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI) Student Unmanned Systems competition](http://www.auvsi-seafarer.org/). It is held each June in Maryland near Lexington Park. Its objectives are to takeoff, navigate a series of GPS way points, enter a search area and land. Throughout the flight surveillance footage is taken and various targets and their characteristics are identified. The more of these tasks that are accomplished autonomously, the higher the score.
